Let go of fear and hold your heart dear.

Become clear of your needs and desires.

Embrace ALL your behaviors! Examine them, and understand what they are and how and IF they are helping you meet your authentic needs.

Allow yourself to tell The Universe your needs and desires, speak forcefully if you must and speak clearly.

Trust that you are heard.
