You must REALLY want something to make the changes you want for yourself.

Visualize yourself in that environment. What are you doing there that is TRULY speaking to one or more of your life's intentions? 

How are you authentically showing up? 

Are you helping others?

Are you creating something?

Are you playing?

IT CAN BE ANYTHING!!

Whatever it is, feel that joy, and visualize it for at least 5 minutes everyday.
