You can control and reshape how you respond.

It is simply a well-worn path formed in your brain since you were a child.

Like a hiking trail in a forest, those the most traveled are the easiest to follow.

Learn to create your own paths that lead you in the direction YOU want to go! This takes a lot of practice, and you must REALLY want it.
