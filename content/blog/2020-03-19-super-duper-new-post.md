Trust that others will help you in your time of need.

Continue to develop your sense of self.

Understand the impact role models have made in your life and how it has shaped your PAST behaviors - and just release those that do not serve and love you!

Explore the possibility in teaching others. LET GO of boundaries that are preventing you from doing so.
